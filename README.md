# Single file executable
The main application is a single `.exe` file, it does not require installation, it creates these files:
- A database file for each user with all the user data.
- A `config.json` file that will contain all the application settings.

You can move the executable file and the database file wherever you want and take all the passwords and data with you, the `config.json` file is not required but you can also copy that file to keep the settings.


# Sqlcipher encrypted database
The database engine used is [sqlcipher](https://github.com/sqlcipher/sqlcipher), an encrypted version of sqlite.  


# Open source ?
The source code is available on my patreon, and if you want you can get a copy by writing to my discord DM, I really want to make this project "Free Source Code", but I don't want them to create vulnerabilities without having it controlled, as I say, this project does not connect to any external server or make shipments, it is all local, and encrypted, with Sqlcipher.


# Completely offline
*"The only secure computer is a computer disconnected from the internet and shutdown!"*  
This application will never use internet to send, receive, or store data, and everything is completely offline.  
All data are yours! Only you have the control!
This also means that if you lost your data no one will be able to retrieve them anymore...
Just backup everything into an external pendrive, this app can be loaded also from pendrives.
